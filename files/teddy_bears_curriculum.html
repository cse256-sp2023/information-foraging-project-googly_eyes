                            Each day we provide predictable routines that establish structure and consistency. We begin our day with free choice play. Children can choose different areas of the room to play in such as: housekeeping, art, science, manipulatives, writing, blocks, sensory table, and books. Clean up time is an important part of our day that teaches responsibility and organization. Next is “Circle Time” where we count the days on the calendar, sing songs and read books. We enjoy a healthy snack and then play on the playground to end our morning.</p>

                        <h4>Fire Drill Practice</h4>
                        Last week we practiced what to do in case of a fire. The children calmly lined up and walked to our designated spot under a tree. The children did a fantastic job and then we enjoyed our time outdoors on the playground. We are proud of our Teddy Bears! In October the Fire Department will come for a visit to teach us more about Fire Safety.

                        <h4>Painting at
                            the Art Easel</h4>
                            Every day the art easel provides our young artists with a unique sensory experience. Developmental skills practiced during easel painting include: Social/emotional as children talk about their creations next to one another Physical - using both small & large muscles of the arm and hand/eye coordination Cognitive - Problem Solving - How do I get the paint to the paper? What happens when I mix colors? What happens when I use a thinner or thicker brush? Why does some paint drip?

                        <h4>Spanish with Miss Colleen</h4>
                        Each week Miss Colleen comes
 to visit our classroom for Spanish.
 We sing songs, play games, and
 learn beginning concepts such as
 counting, colors, shapes, etc.
 Gracias Señora Colleen!
                        </p>

                        <h4>Music with Miss Christina</h4>
                        Last week we had our first
Music class! We began with a
Name & Circle song that helps
us learn each others' names.
We kept the beat with music
sticks and loved moving our
bodies to the rhythm! One of
our favorites is "Put the Baby
in the Bed" - a finger play song.
We ended with a special
version of "Twinke Twinkle
Little Star.

                        <h4>BEARS</h4>
                        The Teddy Bears had a BEARY fun
week learning about all kinds of bearsIn the Art area, we "marble rolled"
bear shapes with different colors of
paint. Using glue sticks, we added
"fur" to our giant bear that now
decorates our Teddy Bear door. At
the writing table we enjoyed bear
shaped stampers. We even turned our
photo faces into bear faces!
Our Bear books included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You See?</li>
                            <li>Polar Bear Polar Bear What Do You Hear?</li>
                            <li>Corduroy Goes to School</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Fire Safety</h4>
                        This week we talked about
Fire Safety and the job of Fire
Fighters. Using finger paints we
created flames of red, yellow
and orange. Finger painting
strengthens our finger and
hand muscles. It provides an
excellent tactile experience
and boosts creativity as we mix
colors together and swirl them
around our papers. A fire
station, fire trucks of all sizes,
and fire fighter dress-ups
provided props for exciting
pretend play.

                        <h4>On Friday the Clayton Fire
                            Department visited WUNS!</h4>
The Teddy Bears enjoyed meeting
Sparky and the fire fighters! Charlie
demonstrated how to "Stop, Drop, &
Roll." They talked to us about calling
911 and creating a safe meeting space
if there is a fire. Due to the rain, we
were not able to view their fire truck.
Remember: "Don't Hide, Go Outside!"

                        <h4>Fall Leaves...</h4>
                        As the weather cools, the
                        Teddy Bears are noticing all
                        sorts of changes. Leaves of
                        changing colors have begun
                        to gather on our playground.
                        We created beautiful leaves
                        for our BIG classroom tree
                        using both tissue paper and
                        paint.

                        <h4>Sensory Play</h4>
                        Each week the Teddy Bears
                        have endless opportunities to
                        explore sensory experiences with
                        water, sand, paint, baking
                        ingredients, play-dough, and so
                        much more. These experiences
                        literally enhance every part of
                        children's development.

                        <h4>Pumpkins</h4>
                        Pumpkins are popping up everywhere! Our science
                        table is home to a nice sized pumpkin.
                        The Teddy Bear love to touch the bright
                        orange skin of the pumpkin. Using their
                        fingers, they trace the vertical lines of the
                        pumpkin. They notice the scratchy, dark
                        green stem on top.
                        Much of our art has been pumpkin
                        themed! The skills used in these projects
                        include: <br>
                        Fine Motor Control: Painting with
                        different size brushes, squeezing glue,
                        cutting with scissors, tearing paper
                        <br>
                        Language: Talking about different
                        pumpkins, comparing and using
                        descriptive words
                        <br>
                        Math: Comparing different sizes of
                        pumpkins in height and weight

                        <h4>Nature with Miss Becky</h4>
                        Our Science theme this month was
                        "Scary Animals." By learning more about
                        wild animals, they won't be so scary to
                        us. Bats, spiders, owls, bees and snakes
                        are some of the animals considered scary
                        by many people. All of these animals are
                        impportant to the environment and many
                        help us by eating mosquitos, insects and
                        mice.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Making Muffins</h4>
                        Last week the Teddy Bears made
                        delicious banana, chocolate chip
                        muffins. Our college helper, Maisie was
                        a huge help in being in charge of the
                        oven and ingredients. The children truly
                        enjoyed stirring, pouring, measuring
                        and, of course, eating the final
                        product. Yummy!!!
                        Cooking or baking with children
                        provides an excellent experience to
                        build self-confidence and some basic
                        skills such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Math skills: measuring, counting,
                                timing, ordering the steps (first, second,
                                third)</li>
                            <li>Building vocabulary & reading
                                skills</li>
                            <li>Fine Motor Skills: pouring, cracking
                                eggs, stirring, scooping, assembling
                                ingredients</li>
                            <li>Exploring senses: smelling, tasting,
                                seeing, listening, and touching</li>
                            <li>Encouraging independence &
                                trying new foods</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="1031">

                        <p>
                        <h4>Colors</h4>
                        We talked all about colors! We
                        made a color wheel of the
                        primary colors: red, blue and
                        yellow. We glued on different
                        colored objects to their matching
                        color. We mixed colored paints
                        together to see what happens.
                        Our sensory table is a favorite
                        area to explore colored water
                        with a variety of objects that sink
                        and float.
                        <ul>Our Color Books:
                            <li>Bear Sees Colors</li>
                            <li>Pete the Cat: I Love my White Shoes</li>
                            <li>A Color of his Own</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Hibernation</h4>
                        Miss Becky talked to our class
                        about animals that hibernate in
                        the winter. Winter can be hard
                        for animals to stay warm or
                        find food to eat. Hibernators
                        include groundhogs, bats,
                        reptiles, amphibians, and some
                        insects. We got to see an
                        actual snake, frog, and toad.
                        We even learned a little song:
                        \t<em>Hibernation, Time for hibernation.<br>
                            Hibernation, Time to go to sleep.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h4>Holidays</h4>
                            Our class has been very busy
                            talking about special traditions
                            that take place this time of
                            year. Miss Maisie helped us
                            bake yummy chocolate chip
                            bread to surprise our families.
                            We also enjoyed her banana
                            carrot bread recipe. Carrot
                            peeling is so much fun! We have
                            also been creating festive
                            artwork: wrapping paper
                            collages, puffy painted
                            pinecones, cookie cutter
                            paintings, sparkly snowflakes
                            with our faces, and we painted
                            a tree branch and added glitter
                            to decorate our room. Boden's
                            Mom shared their Hanuakkah
                            traditions and gave each of us
                            a piece of gelt. What a
                            wonderful time of year!
