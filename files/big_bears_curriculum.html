                    <p>
                        To celebrate the end of our ABC unit, we savored alphabet soup - of course! - and Alphabit
cereal (who knew it was still around?!). Big Bears discovered something special in the precious
pockets of their ABC books, and then put their problem-solving and teamwork skills to good use at
circle. You will have to ask your Big Bears more about that!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Chicks!</h4>
                    <p>    
                        Next up we will dive into our chick unit! Big Bears have
already begun charting the growth of our 16 chicks in their
personal chick folders, marking off each day of growth as they
walk into the classroom. We will continue to use our chick folders
to not only chart growth, but also sketch growth, do fun activities,
and learn new chick development terms.
*If you are interested in adopting a chick, please let us know by
Monday, April 22. Ms. Suzy was a chick mom for years, so if you
have any questions, please ask!
