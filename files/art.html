    Art Enrichment for School Year
    2019-2020</a><br>

<p>
  Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
  Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
  each month and build understanding through conversations and
  experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
  home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
  of Art.

  I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
  since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
  the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am reminded
  and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of
  each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of Art from their
  personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your Preschooler with me!
