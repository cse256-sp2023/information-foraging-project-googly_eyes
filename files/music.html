                                <h2> I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
                                  year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
                                  taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
                                  teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
                                  variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but I
                                  have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
                                  music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
                                  make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to share
                                  that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little boy who is
                                  a Big Bear and Sun Bear.

                                <h2>Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
                                  songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
                                  children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
                                  classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
                                  voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
                                  instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
                                  create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
                                  tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
                                  fun!
