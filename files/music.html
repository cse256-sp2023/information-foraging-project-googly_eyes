<h3>Music with Ms. Christina</h3>
<p>
  I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
  year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
  taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
  teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
  variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but I
  have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
  music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
  make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to share
  that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little boy who is
  a Big Bear and Sun Bear.

  Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
  songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
  children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
  classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
  voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
  instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
  create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
  tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
  fun!
