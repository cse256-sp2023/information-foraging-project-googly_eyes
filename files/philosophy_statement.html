                                    Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
                                    catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
                                    provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
                                    developmental	areas.

                                    The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
                                    approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
                                    consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
                                    children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
                                    class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
                                    the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
                                    music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
                                    and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program.
