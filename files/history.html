            The	Washington	University	Nursery	School	was	founded	in	1947	as	a	cooperative	venture	of	
            faculty	and	Washington	University	in	St.	Louis.	The	primary	purpose	of	the	nursery	school	is	
            to	provide	the	highest	quality	preschool	program	for	children	2	years	and	7	months	to	5	
            years	of	age.	Today	about	70	percent	of	the	children	are	from	families	of	Washington	
            University	in	St.	Louis	faculty,	staff	and	students, and	the	remaining	are	from	families	in	the	
            community.
            Children	come	from	a	variety	of	countries,	cultures	and	economic	backgrounds. The	school	
            maintains	the	high	standards	of	the	National	Association	for	the	Education	of	Young	
            Children,	by	which it is	accredited.	It	is	licensed	by	the	State	of	Missouri.

            The	nursery	school	also	serves	as	a	site	for	research	in	child	development.	Washington	
            University	undergraduate	and	graduate	students	are	employed	to	assist in	the	classrooms.	
            The	classroom	teachers,	as	well	as	the	nursery	school’s	director,	supervise	them.	The	student	
            workers’	presence	enables	children	to	receive	additional	individual	attention.
            The	nursery	school	is	located	on	the	Washington	University	campus.	It	is	composed	of	three	
            classrooms, which	are	designed	to	offer	children	a	variety	of	choices	in	their	play.	Two	
            additional	all-purpose	rooms	are	equipped	with	a	library	and	a	variety	of	indoor	gross	motor	
            play	materials. A	large	outdoor	play	area	gives	children	the	opportunity	to	run,	bike,	swing,	
            climb,	slide	and	play	in	the	sand.
